# front end branch
# do not modify script folder
### TODO
1. Software documentation: each file should have docs in front of the code (each function for back end / script / algorithm)
2. code license
3. environment build
4. test cases (including comments)
5. api validation
6. login permission
7. definition page access
8. report (ch5, 6, 7, appendix C)
9. session

### Problems encountered

FrontEnd

1. Role separation: Manager and planner should have different pages
2. FrontEnd api testing
3. User profile( Display name functionality and Email)
4. User manual not done

BackEnd

1. Api testing
2. Documentation

Script

1. Constraint defined in basic constraint is useless
2. Customized constraint: Coefficient in the math equation does not have a meaning.
3. Flexibility is still low.
